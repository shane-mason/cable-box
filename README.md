3d Printable Cable Box Model

The models were used to make a 3-d printed cable box replica to house a Raspberry Pi 5 for a cable simulation built using FieldStation42.

To use the models, clone the repository and print both sets:

```
CableBox-main.stl - Contains the main box, trim pieces and foot screws.
CableBox-bottom.stl - Conains the bottom of the box.
```

Additional documentation is in-progress.
